## Sound Design Recipes

## Device Chain Patterns

### Standard Insert Chain (on a track)
```
EQ Eight (surgical cuts) → Compressor → Saturator (subtle) → EQ Eight (tonal shaping) → Utility (final trim)
```

### Vocal Chain
```
EQ Eight (HP at 80 Hz, cut mud at 300 Hz) → Compressor (4:1, medium attack) → De-esser (Multiband Dynamics, high band) → EQ Eight (presence boost at 3-5 kHz) → Reverb (20-30% wet, plate)
```

### Drum Bus Chain
```
EQ Eight (HP at 30 Hz) → Glue Compressor (4:1, 10ms attack, 100ms release) → Saturator (subtle drive for warmth) → Utility (trim)
```

### Parallel Compression Setup
Using Audio Effect Rack:
- Chain A: Dry (no processing)
- Chain B: Compressor (heavy — 10:1, fast attack, fast release, low threshold) → balance chain volume

Or using Return track:
1. `create_return_track` for parallel compression
2. Add Compressor with extreme settings on the return
3. Use `set_track_send` to feed signal to the return
4. Blend return level to taste

### Sidechain Ducking Setup
1. Load Compressor on the track to be ducked (bass, pads)
2. Enable Sidechain in Compressor
3. Route kick track to sidechain input
4. Settings: Ratio 4:1-inf:1, Attack 0.1ms, Release 50-200ms, Threshold low
5. Adjust release to match tempo (longer for slower tempos)

## Creative Effects Techniques

### Reverb Freeze
Set Reverb's Freeze parameter to capture and infinitely sustain the current sound. Automate on/off for dramatic transitions.

### Delay Feedback Washes
Automate Delay feedback above 100% briefly — the delay builds and self-oscillates. Pull back before it gets out of control. Great for transitions.

### Beat Repeat (Stock Effect)
Repeats/stutters incoming audio rhythmically.
- `Grid` — Repeat size (1/4 to 1/32)
- `Chance` — Probability of repeating
- `Gate` — How long the repeat runs
- Great for glitch, fills, and transitions

### Grain Delay
Granular delay that can pitch-shift and scatter audio.
- `Pitch` — Transpose the grains
- `Spray` — Randomize grain position
- `Frequency` — Grain rate
- Great for ambient textures and otherworldly effects
