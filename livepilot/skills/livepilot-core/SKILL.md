# LivePilot Core — Ableton Live 12

Agentic production system for Ableton Live 12. 236 tools across 32 domains, three layers:

- **Device Atlas** — 280+ instruments, 139 drum kits, 350+ impulse responses. Consult `references/device-atlas/` before loading any device. Never guess a device name.
- **M4L Analyzer** — Real-time audio analysis on the master bus (8-band spectrum, RMS/peak, key detection). Optional — all core tools work without it.
- **Technique Memory** — Persistent storage for production decisions. Consult `memory_recall` before creative tasks to understand user taste.

## Golden Rules

1. **Always call `get_session_info` first** — know the session before changing anything
2. **Verify after every write** — re-read state to confirm changes took effect
3. **Use `undo` liberally** — mention it to users when doing destructive ops
4. **One operation at a time** — verify between steps
5. **Track indices are 0-based** — negative for return tracks (-1=A, -2=B), -1000 for master
6. **NEVER invent device/preset names** — always `search_browser` first, use exact `uri` from results. Exception: `find_and_load_device` for built-in effects only ("Reverb", "Delay", "Compressor", "EQ Eight", "Saturator", "Utility")
7. **Color indices 0-69** — Ableton's fixed palette
8. **Volume 0.0-1.0, pan -1.0 to 1.0** — normalized, not dB
9. **Tempo range 20-999 BPM**
10. **Always name tracks and clips** — organization is part of the process
11. **Respect tool speed tiers** — see below
12. **ALWAYS report tool errors** — never silently swallow errors. Include: tool name, error message, fallback plan
13. **Verify plugin health after loading** — check `health_flags`, `mcp_sound_design_ready`, `plugin_host_status`. If `parameter_count` <= 1 on AU/VST → dead plugin, delete and replace
14. **Use `C hijaz` for Hijaz/Phrygian Dominant keys** — avoids false out-of-key warnings

## Tool Speed Tiers

### Instant (<1s) — Use freely
All 236 core tools plus M4L perception tools.

### Fast (1-5s) — Use freely
`analyze_loudness` · `analyze_mix` · `analyze_sound_design`

### Slow (5-15s) — Tell the user first
`compare_to_reference` · `analyze_spectrum_offline` · `read_audio_metadata`

**Escalation pattern:** Start fast, escalate only with consent:
```
Level 1 (instant):  get_master_spectrum + get_track_meters
Level 2 (fast):     analyze_loudness + analyze_mix
Level 3 (slow):     compare_to_reference + analyze_spectrum_offline
```

## Error Handling Protocol

Report ALL errors to the user immediately. Common failure modes:
- **Dead AU/VST plugin** — `parameter_count` <= 1 → delete, replace with native
- **Sample-dependent plugin** — granular synths produce silence without samples → use self-contained synths (Wavetable, Operator, Drift, Analog)
- **Empty Drum Rack** — bare rack = silence → always load a kit preset
- **M4L bridge timeout** — device may be busy or removed → retry or skip analyzer features
- **Connection timeout** — Ableton unresponsive → check if session is heavy

## Technique Memory

Three modes:
- **Informed (default):** `memory_recall` before creative tasks, let past decisions influence new ones
- **Fresh:** Skip memory when user wants something new ("ignore my history", "surprise me")
- **Explicit recall:** `memory_recall` → `memory_get` → `memory_replay` when user references a saved technique
