## What LivePilot Does

Most MCP servers are tool collections — they execute commands. LivePilot is an **agentic production system**. It has six layers that work together:

| Layer | What it provides |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Deterministic Tools** | Direct control: transport, tracks, clips, notes, devices, scenes, mixing, arrangement, browser, automation |
| **Device Atlas** | Knowledge of every device in Ableton's library — 1305 devices indexed by name, URI, category, tag, and genre. 71 enriched with sonic intelligence. 683 drum kits mapped |
| **Sample Engine** | Three-source sample intelligence — searches Ableton's browser, your filesystem, and Splice's catalog simultaneously. 6 fitness critics score every result. 29 processing techniques |
| **Spectral Perception** | Real-time ears via M4L — 8-band FFT, RMS/peak metering, Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection, pitch tracking. Closes the feedback loop so the AI hears its own changes |
| **Technique Memory** | Persistent library of production decisions. Save a beat pattern, device chain, or mix template. Recall by mood, genre, or texture across sessions |
| **Creative Intelligence** | 12 engines that understand song identity, learn your taste, diagnose stuck sessions, generate creative options, and evaluate results before claiming success |

### How the pieces connect

**Remote Script** (`remote_script/LivePilot/`) — A Python ControlSurface that runs inside Ableton's process. Listens on TCP 9878. All Live Object Model calls execute on Ableton's main thread via `schedule_message`. Detects Ableton version at startup and enables three capability tiers: Core (12.0+), Enhanced Arrangement (12.1.10+), Full Intelligence (12.3+).

**MCP Server** (`mcp_server/`) — Python FastMCP server. Validates inputs, routes commands to the Remote Script over TCP, manages the M4L bridge, runs the atlas, sample engine, composer, and all intelligence engines. This is what your AI client connects to.

**M4L Bridge** (`m4l_device/`) — Optional Max for Live Audio Effect on the master track. Provides deep LOM access through Max's LiveAPI that the ControlSurface API can't reach. UDP 9880 (M4L to server) carries spectral data and LiveAPI responses. OSC 9881 (server to M4L) sends commands. The 32 spectral/analyzer tools strictly require the bridge; device and sample tools that call the bridge also have graceful fallbacks, so core functionality works without it. Backed by 30 bridge commands for hidden parameters, Simpler internals, warp markers, display values, and Simpler warp / Compressor sidechain writes that live on child objects Python can't reach.

**Device Atlas** (`mcp_server/atlas/`) — In-memory indexed JSON database. 1305 devices with browser URIs, 71 enriched with YAML sonic intelligence profiles (mood, genre, texture, recommended chains). 6 indexes: by_id, by_name, by_uri, by_category, by_tag, by_genre. The AI never hallucinates a device name or preset — it always resolves against the atlas first.

**Sample Engine** (`mcp_server/sample_engine/`) — Searches three sources simultaneously: BrowserSource (Ableton's library), SpliceSource (local Splice catalog via SQLite), FilesystemSource (user directories). Every result passes through a 6-critic fitness battery (key, tempo, spectral, genre, mood, technical). 29 processing techniques (Surgeon precision vs. Alchemist experimentation). Builds complete sample processing plans with warp, slice, and effect recommendations.

**Splice Client** (`mcp_server/splice_client/`) — Searches Splice's catalog through two layers: the local SQLite database (`sounds.db`, already-downloaded samples) and the live gRPC API (full catalog, including samples you haven't downloaded yet). The gRPC client auto-detects Splice's dynamic port via `port.conf`, handles self-signed TLS, and enforces a 5-credit safety floor before any download. Per-call timeouts (5–10s) prevent a hung Splice process from stalling the MCP event loop. Graceful fallback to SQL-only if grpcio isn't installed. No API key needed — authentication comes from the running Splice desktop app.

**Composer** (`mcp_server/composer/`) — Prompt-to-plan pipeline. Parses natural language ("dark minimal techno 128bpm with industrial textures") into a CompositionIntent (genre, mood, tempo, key). Plans layers using role templates (kick, bass, percussion, texture, lead, pad, fx). Compiles to a step-by-step plan of tool calls that the agent executes. Does not execute autonomously — returns the plan. 4 genre defaults (house, techno, trap, ambient) — genres outside this set fall back to a neutral layer plan.

**Corpus** (`mcp_server/corpus/`) — Parsed device-knowledge markdown converted to queryable Python structures: EmotionalRecipe, GenreChain, PhysicalModelRecipe, AutomationGesture. Feeds Wonder Mode, Sound Design critics, and the Composer with deep creative knowledge at runtime — not just LLM prompts, actual structured data.

**Execution Router** (`mcp_server/runtime/execution_router.py`) — Classifies each step in a multi-step plan as remote_command (TCP to Ableton), bridge_command (OSC to M4L), or mcp_tool (internal), then dispatches it through the correct channel.

## The Intelligence Layer

12 engines sit on top of the 421 tools. They give the AI musical judgment, not just musical execution.

### SongBrain — What the Song Is

Builds a real-time model of the session: identity core (what defines this track), sacred elements (what must not be casually damaged), section purposes (what each part is doing emotionally), energy arc (where the song is heading). Detects identity drift when edits pull the track away from what made it work.

### Taste Graph — What You Like

Learns your production preferences across sessions. Tracks which move families you keep vs. undo, which devices you gravitate toward, how experimental you want suggestions (novelty band), and which dimensions you avoid. Every accept/reject updates the graph. Two producers using the same tools get different recommendations.

### Semantic Moves — Musical Actions, Not Parameters

26+ high-level intents ("add contrast," "tighten the low end," "build tension") that compile into tool sequences. Each move carries a risk level, target dimensions, and protection thresholds. The AI knows what it's risking with every action.

### Wonder Mode — Stuck-Rescue Workflow

When a session is stuck — repeated undos, overpolished loops, no structural progress — Wonder Mode activates:

1. **Diagnose** — classify the stuckness (loop trap? missing contrast? identity unclear?)
2. **Generate** — find semantic moves that address the diagnosis, enforcing real distinctness
3. **Preview** — apply each variant, capture, undo. Hear before committing
4. **Commit or Reject** — choice recorded into taste and session continuity

### Creative Engines

| Engine | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mix Engine** | Critic-driven analysis: masking, headroom, stereo, dynamics. Plans corrective moves with before/after evaluation |
| **Sound Design Engine** | Analyzes patches for static timbre, missing modulation, weak transients. Suggests parameter moves |
| **Transition Engine** | Classifies transition types (drop, build, breakdown). Scores quality, plans improvements from archetypes |
| **Composition Engine** | Section analysis, motif detection, emotional arcs. Plans structural moves |
| **Performance Engine** | Safety-constrained suggestions for live sets. Knows which moves risk audio dropouts |
| **Reference Engine** | Distills principles from reference tracks. Maps them to your session as concrete moves |

### Hook Hunter

Identifies the most salient musical idea — ranks candidates by recurrence across scenes, motif salience, and section placement (payoff-section boost). Tracks whether hooks are developed, neglected, or undermined, and flags when a transition fails to deliver expected payoff. Rhythm-side ranking is currently heuristic (drum-track detection + clip reuse); true onset-based rhythmic features are on the roadmap.

### Session Continuity

Maintains creative threads ("the chorus needs more lift") and turn resolutions across the session. When you return to a project: *"Last time, you kept the filter sweep for the bridge. The chorus lift thread is still open."*

### Evaluation Loop

Every engine follows: **measure before → act → measure after → compare**. If a change made things worse (more masking, lost headroom, identity drift), the system flags it before you move on.

<br>

### M4L Bridge — 30 tools `[optional]`

The M4L Analyzer sits on the master track. UDP 9880 carries spectral data to the server. OSC 9881 sends commands back.

> [!TIP]
> Most tools work without the analyzer — it adds 32 spectral/analyzer tools (frequency, loudness, perception) and closes the feedback loop.

```
SPECTRAL ─────── 8-band frequency decomposition (sub → air)
                 true RMS / peak metering
                 Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection

The atlas is an in-memory indexed database of Ableton's entire device library.

```
1305 devices total
  71 enriched with sonic intelligence (mood, genre, texture, chains)
 683 drum kits mapped with note assignments
   6 indexes: by_id, by_name, by_uri, by_category, by_tag, by_genre

get_sample_technique   Get detailed recipe for a specific technique
```

<br>

### Splice Integration

LivePilot reads Splice's local SQLite database to search your downloaded samples with full metadata. No API key needed — it reads the database file directly.

**What it does:**
- Searches your downloaded Splice samples with key, BPM, genre, and tag metadata
- Integrates as a third source alongside Ableton's browser and filesystem scanning
- Works without a Splice subscription — any previously downloaded samples are searchable

**How it works:** The Sample Engine's `SpliceSource` reads `~/Library/Application Support/com.splice.Splice/users/default/*/sounds.db` — Splice's local SQLite catalog of downloaded samples. Read-only, no network calls.

**Requirements:** Splice desktop app running (the MCP server talks to it over gRPC at a dynamic port advertised via `port.conf`, with self-signed TLS). For fully offline search, previously-downloaded samples are always searchable via the local SQLite fallback even if the Splice app isn't running.

<br>

### Composer — 3 tools

Prompt-to-plan auto-composition engine.

```

<summary><strong>3. M4L Analyzer (optional — adds 27 tools)</strong></summary>

Drag `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` onto the master track for real-time spectral analysis.
The `--setup` wizard and Desktop Extension do this automatically.

> **Important:** The Analyzer must be the LAST device on the master track — after all effects (EQ, Compressor, Utility) so it reads the final output signal.

<summary><strong>4. Splice (optional — adds sample catalog)</strong></summary>

If you have Splice installed with downloaded samples, the Sample Engine can search them with full metadata (key, BPM, genre, tags) via the local SQLite database.

No API key, no configuration — the Sample Engine reads Splice's `sounds.db` file directly.

Without Splice, the Sample Engine still searches Ableton's browser and your filesystem.

## Plugin

**Codex App**

```bash
npx livepilot --install-codex-plugin
```

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude plugin add github:dreamrec/LivePilot/plugin
```

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `/session` | Full session overview with diagnostics |
| `/beat` | Guided beat creation |
| `/arrange` | Guided arrangement and song structure |
| `/mix` | Mixing assistant |
| `/sounddesign` | Sound design workflow |
| `/perform` | Live performance mode with safety constraints |
| `/evaluate` | Before/after evaluation of recent changes |
| `/memory` | Technique library management |

**Producer Agent** — an orchestrated multi-step assistant for building,
layering and refining sessions. Consults memory for style context, searches
the atlas for instruments, searches samples, creates tracks, programs MIDI,
chains effects, reads the spectrum to verify, and arranges sections. The
agent proposes plans; the user confirms and listens. LivePilot is a high-
trust operator, not an autonomous producer.

**Core Skill** — operational discipline connecting all layers.
Consult atlas before loading. Read analyzer after mixing.
Check memory before creative decisions. Verify every mutation.
